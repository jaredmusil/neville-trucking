## ROLL-OFF DUMPSTERS

Contact us about your project and we will help you decide what size roll-off you will need. 
We require a 2 ton minimum up front. If your container doesn't exceed the 2 tons we will credit back the difference. 

| Size | Dimensions | Cost / Dump with 2 Ton Minimum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 Yards | 10'L x 8'W x 4'H | $200 + $70 per ton = $340 |
| 20 Yards | 20'L x 8'W x 4'H | $250 + $70 per ton = $390 |
| 30 Yards | 20'L x 8'W x 6'H | $300 + $70 per ton = $440 |

By state law, the landfill will not allow: tires, yard waste, appliances, or electronics. For information on how to dispose of these items, contact us.
